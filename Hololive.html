        <h2>What's Hololive</h2>
        <p>Hololive is an "Idol" group, the word idol goes in quotations because even though at first the group was intended to be a regular idol group, but with 
            live2D avatars, they quickly shifted from this mindset to just being an entertainment company. Nowadays what remains of the old mindset is that 
            the group is still invested in the music industry, with talents going concerts and stuff from time to time. 
            <br> 
            <br>
            There are some members that are still mainly focused on music related work but they also streams games and other kind of content.

        <h2>Gen 0</h2>
        <p>Gen 0 was the first gen created, at first it was just Sora and Roboco, both had 3D models from the start, and they still use these models instead
            of live2D. This gen was an unofficial gen at first, but due to Miko and Suisei addition to the main branch, they eventually adopted the term "Gen 0"
            and made it an official generation inside of Hololive production.
